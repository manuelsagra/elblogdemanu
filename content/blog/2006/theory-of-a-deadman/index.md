Aunque ya hace un tiempo que me pasé "_[Fahrenheit](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_(videojuego_de_2005))_", uno de los grandes juegos del año pasado, ahora me ha dado por dedicarle tiempo al disco que se puede escuchar en varios momentos a lo largo del juego.

**Theory of a Deadman** puede que sea otra banda de Rock, pero desde luego sus letras y su música evocan algo más. A destacar los temas "_No Way Out_", "_No Surprise_" y "_Santa Monica_". Me encanta la letra de esta última, aunque también es verdad que sin la voz desgarradora del cantante no es lo mismo...

> She fills my bed with gasoline\
  You think I wouldn't notice\
  Her mind's made up\
  Her love is gone\
  I think someone's trying to show us a sign\
  That even if we thought it would last\
  The moment would pass\
  My bones will break and my heart would give\
  \
  And I remember the day when you left for Santa Monica\
  You left me to remain with all your excuses for everything\
  And I remember the time when you left for Santa Monica\
  And I remember the day you told me it's over\
  \
  It hurts to breathe\
  Well every time that you're not next to me\
  Her mind's made up\
  The girl is gone\
  And now I'm forced to see\
  I think I'm on my way\
  Oh, it hurts to live today\
  Oh and she says "Don't you wish you were dead like me?"\
  \
  And I remember the day when you left for Santa Monica\
  You left me to remain with all your excuses for everything\
  And I remember the time when you left for Santa Monica\
  And I remember the day you told me it's over\
  \
  I wanted more than this\
  I needed more than this\
  I could use of more than this\
  But it just won't stop\
  It just won't go away\
  \
  I needed more than this\
  I wanted more than this\
  I asked for more than this\
  But it just won't stop\
  It just won't go away\
  \
  And I remember the day when you left for Santa Monica\
  You left me to remain with all your excuses for everything\
  And I remember the time when you left it all behind\
  And I remember the day you told me it's over\
  \
  And I remember the day when you left for Santa Monica\
  You left me to remain with all your excuses for everything\
  And I remember the time when you left for Santa Monica\
  Yeah, I remember the day you told me it's over
