This privacy policy governs the manner in which Circlexplosion collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the Circlexplosion mobile application ("App"). The App is a casual game with the goal of clearing circles when they turn green.

## Personal identification information

Circlexplosion does not collect any personal identification information from Users.

## Non-personal identification information

As with any other application distributed with Google Play, there is some non-personal identification information collected about the device, operating system and its location when you download it.

## How I use collected information

Circlexplosion itself does not collect any information from Users; therefore, no information is used in any manner.

## Sharing your personal information

I do not sell, trade or rent User's personal identification to others. Since I do not collect any personal identification information, there is no information to share.

## Changes to this privacy policy

Circlexplosion has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When I do, I will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. I encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how I am helping to protect the personal information I collect. You acknowledge and agree that is your responsability to review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.

## Your acceptance of these terms

By using this App, you signify your acceptance of this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please don not use my App. Your continued use of the App following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your aceptance of those changes.

## Contacting me

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, the practices of this App, or your dealings with this App, please contact me at [manuelsagra@gmail.com](mailto:manuelsagra@gmail.com).
